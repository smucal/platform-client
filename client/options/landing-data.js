There, I worked with an A-team of Web, Dev Ops, and Cryptocurrency Developers; and despite that, it was brutal as coding always is… However, working under the wings of two Seasoned Programmers, Oleksii Vasylenko(Front-End Dev Lead of Xen) and Andrei Karpushonak(CTO of Xen), helped me learn much of what I know, love and do today…\nDuring my time at Xen, I maintained 3 of the 9 Repositories here at Xen with the help of Oleksii and 2 others; helped coordinate front-end development for 2 Company deadlines; and created an NPM repository for the form components used by the company.'

    description: 'Creating this webpage was a personal milestone for me to understand the design process of a webpage from the ground up, the color palette of a site, to the positioning of website components that changes between devices. To plan it from the ground up was and is (at the time of writing this) amazing…\nThe complexity of keeping a design simple, of using colours to draw and pull attention, and creation of png images using various design tools, really opened my eyes to the beauty of making something beautiful. It is July 2019, and as proud I am of this website, I hope that I have grown when it comes to web design in the time that has elapsed. Take a peek at my more recent projects to see how I am doing now!'
